Remedi UltraSound
-----------------

This project tries to create an open-source Ultasound platform. For more info 
see http://www.remedi.co. See \ref licensing for the information about open 
source.

A high-level description of the system is given in the \ref system_description.
Some \ref requirements have been created, but these are still very much open to
 discussion.

The compiled documentation can be read at http://remediosm.github.io/UltraSound/
